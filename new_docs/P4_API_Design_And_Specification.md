# P4: API Design and Specification

## 1. Introduction

This document details the design and specification for the external-facing API of the Remote Cline Agent Platform. This API will be used by the Web Application/Dashboard and potentially by third-party client applications or CI/CD systems.

## 2. API Design Principles

*   **RESTful:** Adhere to REST principles where appropriate, using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), status codes, and resource-based URLs.
*   **Stateless:** Each API request should contain all information needed to process it.
*   **Secure:** All endpoints must be secured using robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
*   **Versioned:** Implement API versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/...`) to allow for future non-breaking changes.
*   **Well-Documented:** Provide clear and comprehensive API documentation (e.g., using OpenAPI/Swagger).
*   **Consistent:** Use consistent naming conventions, request/response structures, and error handling.
*   **Idempotent (for mutating operations):** Ensure that making the same mutating request multiple times has the same effect as making it once (e.g., for PUT, DELETE).

## 3. Authentication and Authorization

*   **Authentication Method (TBD):**
    *   **OAuth 2.0 (Client Credentials or Authorization Code flow):** Suitable for third-party applications and the primary Web Application.
    *   **API Keys:** Simpler for direct server-to-server integrations or CLI tools. Must be securely generated, stored, and managed by users.
*   **Authorization:**
    *   Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or permission-based system to control access to resources and actions based on user roles or assigned permissions.
    *   Ensure users can only access and manage their own tasks, agents, and data unless explicitly granted wider permissions (e.g., team-based access).

## 4. API Endpoints (Illustrative - Subject to Refinement)

### 4.2. Task Management

*   **`POST /tasks`**
    *   Description: Create and submit a new task for a Remote Cline Agent.
    *   Request Body:
        ```json
        {
          "name": "Refactor login module",
          "description": "Refactor the legacy login module to use modern patterns and improve test coverage.",
          "repository_url": "https://github.com/user/repo.git",
          "branch": "main", // Branch to operate on
          "target_branch_prefix": "cline-agent/", // Prefix for new branch agent will create
          "context_files": ["src/auth/login.js", "tests/auth/login.test.js"], // Optional: specific files to focus on
          "instructions": "...", // Detailed instructions for the agent
          "agent_config": { // Optional: agent-specific configurations
            "model_preference": "claude-3-opus",
            "max_iterations": 10
          },
          "notifications_enabled": true
        }
        ```
    *   Response: Task object (with ID, status: "queued").
*   **`GET /tasks`**
    *   Description: List all tasks for the authenticated user.
    *   Query Parameters: `status` (queued, running, completed, failed), `limit`, `offset`.
    *   Response: Paginated list of task objects.
*   **`GET /tasks/{task_id}`**
    *   Description: Get details of a specific task.
    *   Response: Task object.
*   **`POST /tasks/{task_id}/cancel`**
    *   Description: Request cancellation of a running task.
    *   Response: Updated task object (status: "cancelling" or "cancelled").
*   **`GET /tasks/{task_id}/logs`**
    *   Description: Get logs for a specific task (can support streaming or pagination).
    *   Response: Log entries.
*   **`GET /tasks/{task_id}/artifacts`**
    *   Description: List artifacts generated by a task.
    *   Response: List of artifact metadata (name, size, download_url).
*   **`GET /tasks/{task_id}/artifacts/{artifact_name}`**
    *   Description: Download a specific artifact.
    *   Response: File stream.
*   **`GET /tasks/{task_id}/diff`** (If applicable, for code changes)
    *   Description: Get the code diff generated by the task.
    *   Response: Diff content (e.g., in unified diff format).

### 4.3. Repository/VCS Management (Optional - could be part of task creation)

*   **`POST /repositories`**
    *   Description: Link a new repository to the user's account (e.g., for storing access credentials).
    *   Request Body: `repository_url`, `access_token` (if private, handled securely).
    *   Response: Repository link object.
*   **`GET /repositories`**
    *   Description: List linked repositories.
    *   Response: List of repository link objects.

## 5. Common Request/Response Structures

*   **Standard Error Response:**
    ```json
    {
      "error": {
        "code": "ERROR_CODE_EXAMPLE",
        "message": "A descriptive error message.",
        "details": { /* Optional additional details */ }
      }
    }
    ```
*   **Pagination:** Use `limit` and `offset` query parameters for collections. Responses should include total count and links for next/previous pages.

## 6. Rate Limiting

*   Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.
*   Communicate rate limit information via HTTP headers (e.g., `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`).

## 7. API Documentation

*   **Tool:** OpenAPI Specification (formerly Swagger).
*   **Hosting:** Generate interactive API documentation (e.g., Swagger UI, Redocly).
*   **Content:** Detailed descriptions of each endpoint, parameters, request/response schemas, authentication methods, and error codes.

## 8. Versioning Strategy

*   URL-based versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/...`).
*   Increment major version for breaking changes. Minor/patch versions for non-breaking additions/fixes can be handled without URL change if backward compatibility is maintained.
