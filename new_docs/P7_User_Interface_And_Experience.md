# P7: User Interface and Experience (UI/UX)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the design considerations and key features for the user-facing Web Application / Dashboard of the Remote Cline Agent Platform. The goal is to provide an intuitive, efficient, and informative experience for users managing their AI agents and tasks.

## 2. Guiding Principles for UI/UX

*   **Clarity:** Users should easily understand how to define tasks, monitor progress, and interpret results.
*   **Simplicity:** Avoid unnecessary complexity. Streamline common workflows.
*   **Efficiency:** Enable users to accomplish their goals with minimal effort.
*   **Feedback:** Provide clear and timely feedback on system status, task progress, and agent actions.
*   **Control:** Users should feel in control of their tasks and agent configurations.
*   **Responsiveness:** The UI should be fast and responsive across different devices (desktop-first, but consider responsive design for tablet/mobile viewing).
*   **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent design language and interaction patterns throughout the application.

## 3. Key UI Sections and Features

### 3.1. User Authentication and Account Management

*   **Registration Page:** Simple form for new user sign-up (email, password, name).
*   **Login Page:** Secure login for existing users.

*   **Summary View:**
    *   Quick overview of active tasks, recently completed tasks, and any tasks requiring attention (e.g., pending input, failed).
    *   Key statistics (e.g., total tasks run, estimated time saved - future).
    *   Quick links to create a new task or view all tasks.

### 3.3. Task Creation / Definition

*   **Intuitive Form-Based Interface:**
    *   **Task Name/Description:** Clear textual input.

        *   Specify branch.
    *   **Task Instructions:** Rich text editor or markdown input for detailed instructions to the agent.
        *   Consider templates for common task types (e.g., "Write unit tests," "Refactor module," "Generate documentation").
    *   **Context Files (Optional):** Allow users to specify particular files or directories for the agent to focus on.
    *   **Agent Configuration (Optional):**
        *   Select AI model preference (if multiple are available).
        *   Set parameters like max iterations, verbosity.
    *   **Target Branch Naming:** Define prefix or pattern for agent-created branches.
    *   **Notification Settings:** Enable/disable notifications for this task.

*   **Agent Configuration:** Display the configuration used for this task.
*   **Error Details (if failed):** Clear presentation of error messages and relevant log snippets.
*   **Timeline/Event Log:** A chronological view of key events during the task's lifecycle.

### 3.6. VCS Integration Management

*   **Dedicated section for managing linked repositories.**
*   **Link New Repository:**
    *   OAuth flow for GitHub/GitLab for seamless integration.
    *   Option to manually add repository URL and PAT (with clear security warnings and instructions for scoped tokens).
*   **List Linked Repositories:** Display name, provider, and status of integration.
*   **Edit/Revoke Access:** Allow users to update credentials or remove linked repositories.

### 3.7. Notifications

*   **In-App Notification Center:** A bell icon or similar to display recent notifications.
