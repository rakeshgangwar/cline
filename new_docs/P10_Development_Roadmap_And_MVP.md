# P10: Development Roadmap and Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a phased development roadmap for the Remote Cline Agent Platform, starting with the definition of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The roadmap will guide development efforts, allowing for iterative delivery and feedback.

## 2. Guiding Principles for Roadmap

*   **Iterative Development:** Deliver value incrementally.
*   **Focus on Core Value:** The MVP should deliver the core functionality that solves a primary user problem.
*   **Feedback-Driven:** Incorporate user feedback from early versions to guide future development.
*   **Technical Foundation:** Ensure the MVP builds a solid technical foundation for future scalability and feature expansion.

## 3. Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Definition

The MVP will focus on enabling a single user to submit a defined type of coding task (e.g., code formatting, simple test generation) to a Remote Cline Agent, have it executed against a public GitHub repository, and receive the results as a Pull Request.

### 3.1. MVP Scope - Key Features:

*   **User Management (Basic):**
    *   User registration (email/password).
    *   User login.
*   **Core Cline Agent Adaptation (Headless):**
    *   Ability to run the Cline engine headlessly in a container.
    *   Support for at least one simple, well-defined tool (e.g., code formatting using a standard linter/formatter, or a very basic test generation prompt).
    *   Basic input (task instructions, repo URL) and output (logs, diff/PR URL) handling.
*   **Cloud Infrastructure (Minimal):**
    *   Ability to run agent containers (e.g., on a single node Kubernetes cluster or a simpler container service like AWS ECS Fargate/Azure Container Instances for MVP).
    *   Basic API Gateway.
*   **Task Orchestration (Simplified):**
    *   Receive task via API.
    *   Queue task (simple in-memory queue or basic message queue for MVP).
    *   Assign task to an available (or newly spun-up) agent instance.
    *   Track basic task status (queued, running, completed, failed).
*   **VCS Management (GitHub - Public Repos):**
    *   Agent can clone a public GitHub repository.
    *   Agent can create a new branch.
    *   Agent can commit changes.
    *   Agent can push the new branch.
    *   Agent (or a simple script triggered by orchestrator) can create a Pull Request on GitHub using a provided user PAT (user enters PAT in UI, passed securely to agent for this one task - MVP simplification, to be improved post-MVP).
*   **Web Application / UI (Minimal):**
    *   Page to submit a new task (input repo URL, branch, simple instructions, GitHub PAT).
    *   Page to view a list of submitted tasks and their status.
    *   Page to view task details (logs, link to PR).
*   **API (Internal-Facing for UI):**
    *   Endpoints for task submission and status retrieval.
*   **Security (Foundational):**
    *   HTTPS for all communication.
    *   Secure storage of user passwords.
    *   Basic input validation.

### 3.2. MVP - Explicitly Out of Scope:

*   Support for private repositories (due to complexity of robust credential management for MVP).
*   Advanced user/team management, roles, and permissions.
*   Complex task types or highly configurable agents.
*   Sophisticated agent auto-scaling (manual scaling or fixed pool for MVP).
*   Advanced UI features (rich text editors, diff viewers in UI, etc.).
*   Notifications (users will check UI for status).
*   Billing and subscription management.
*   Support for other VCS providers (GitLab, Bitbucket).
*   Extensive error handling and retry mechanisms in the orchestrator.
*   Comprehensive monitoring and alerting dashboard for operations.
*   API for third-party client consumption (focus on UI-driven interaction).

## 4. Development Roadmap

### Phase 0: Foundation & Prototyping (Pre-MVP)

*   **Goal:** Validate core technical assumptions.
*   **Activities:**
    *   Prototype headless Cline engine execution.
    *   Experiment with containerizing the Cline engine.
    *   Basic script for cloning a repo, running a simple Cline task, and committing changes.
    *   Setup initial cloud provider account and basic networking.
    *   Technology selection for key components (backend language, UI framework, basic container runtime).

### Phase 1: MVP Development

*   **Goal:** Deliver the MVP as defined above.
*   **Key Milestones:**
    1.  User registration/login backend and UI.
    2.  Headless Cline agent container capable of a single, simple task (e.g., formatting).
    3.  Basic Task Orchestrator: API endpoint for task submission, simple queue, agent invocation.
    4.  Agent integration: Cloning public GitHub repo, creating branch, committing, pushing.
    5.  GitHub PR creation (using user-provided PAT for MVP).
    6.  Minimal UI for task submission and status viewing (including logs and PR link).
    7.  End-to-end testing of the MVP flow.
    8.  Basic deployment pipeline.

### Phase 2: Post-MVP Enhancements (Iteration 1)

*   **Goal:** Improve usability, security, and support for core use cases.
*   **Potential Features:**
    *   **Private Repository Support:** Secure GitHub App integration or OAuth for robust credential management (replacing user PAT input per task).
    *   **Improved Task Definition UI:** Better instruction input, context file selection.
    *   **Enhanced Task Detail View:** Basic diff viewer in UI.
    *   **Notifications:** Basic email notifications for task completion/failure.
    *   **More Agent Tools/Capabilities:** Support for 1-2 additional common task types (e.g., basic test generation, documentation stubs).
    *   **Improved Orchestrator:** Better error handling, basic retries.
    *   **Basic Agent Auto-Scaling:** Based on queue length.
    *   **Operational Monitoring:** Basic logging and monitoring dashboard for the platform.

### Phase 3: Feature Expansion (Iteration 2)

*   **Goal:** Broaden platform capabilities and user base.
*   **Potential Features:**
    *   **Support for other VCS Providers:** GitLab integration.
    *   **Team/Organization Accounts:** Basic multi-user collaboration features.
    *   **Configurable Agent Parameters:** Allow users more control over agent behavior (model selection, tool parameters).
    *   **Public API:** Well-documented API for third-party integrations.
    *   **Advanced Task Types:** Support for more complex refactoring, migration tasks.
    *   **Improved Security:** MFA, advanced RBAC.
    *   **Webhook Notifications.**

### Phase 4: Maturity and Scale (Iteration 3+)

*   **Goal:** Achieve platform maturity, scalability, and enterprise readiness.
*   **Potential Features:**
    *   **Advanced Scalability & Reliability:** Multi-region deployments, advanced DR.
    *   **Billing and Subscription Tiers.**
    *   **Marketplace for Agent Skills/Templates (Long-term).**
    *   **Compliance Certifications (SOC 2, etc.).**
    *   **Advanced Analytics and Reporting.**
    *   **Sophisticated AI-driven task planning within agents.**

## 5. Timelines (High-Level Estimates - TBD)

*   **Phase 0:** (e.g., 2-4 weeks)
*   **Phase 1 (MVP):** (e.g., 3-6 months)
*   **Subsequent Phases:** (e.g., 3-6 months each, depending on feature complexity and team size)

*These timelines are highly dependent on team size, expertise, and the final detailed scope of each phase.*
