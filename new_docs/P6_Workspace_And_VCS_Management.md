# P6: Workspace and Version Control System (VCS) Management

## 1. Introduction

This document details how Remote Cline Agents will interact with source code repositories, manage their local workspaces, and integrate with Version Control Systems (VCS) like Git, primarily focusing on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, etc.

## 2. Core Components Involved

*   **Cline Agent Instance (Headless Cline Engine):** Performs VCS operations within its workspace.
*   **VCS Integration Service (or logic within Agent/Orchestrator):** May centralize some VCS interactions or credential management.
*   **Task Orchestrator:** Provides task-specific VCS parameters (repo URL, branch, etc.).
*   **Secure Credentials Vault:** Stores access tokens for private repositories.
*   **Git Providers (GitHub, GitLab, etc.):** External services hosting the repositories.

## 3. Workspace Management for Agents

*   **Isolation:** Each Cline Agent Instance will have an isolated, ephemeral workspace (e.g., a dedicated directory within its container's file system). This prevents interference between concurrently running tasks.
*   **Lifecycle:**
    1.  **Setup:** When an agent is assigned a task, its workspace is prepared.
    2.  **Cloning:** The specified repository and branch are cloned into the workspace.
    3.  **Operation:** The Headless Cline Engine performs file modifications, runs commands, etc., within this workspace.
    4.  **Cleanup:** After task completion (success, failure, or cancellation), the workspace is typically cleaned or the entire agent instance (including its workspace) is destroyed and recreated for the next task. This ensures a fresh environment for each task.
*   **Size Considerations:** Workspaces must accommodate the size of the repositories being processed. Temporary storage limits for agent instances need to be defined.

## 4. VCS Operations by Agents

### 4.1. Cloning Repositories

*   Agents will use standard Git commands to clone repositories.
*   **Public Repositories:** Cloned directly using the HTTPS URL.
*   **Private Repositories:**
    *   Requires authentication. Agents will be provided with short-lived access tokens or use centrally managed credentials (via VCS Integration Service) retrieved from the Secure Credentials Vault.
    *   Supported methods: HTTPS with a token, or SSH keys (if SSH key management is implemented for agents). HTTPS with tokens is generally simpler for ephemeral agents.

### 4.2. Branching Strategy

1.  **Source Branch:** The task definition will specify the source branch to operate on (e.g., `main`, `develop`, a feature branch).
2.  **Working Branch:** Upon cloning, the agent will typically create a new working branch from the source branch.
    *   **Naming Convention:** A consistent naming convention for agent-created branches is crucial (e.g., `cline-agent/<task-type>/<short-task-id>`, `cline/<original-branch>-<task-id>`). The `target_branch_prefix` from the task definition can be used.
    *   This isolates agent work and prevents direct commits to important branches.

### 4.3. Committing Changes

*   Agents will commit changes made during task execution to their working branch.
*   **Commit Messages:**
    *   Should be clear, descriptive, and potentially standardized (e.g., prefixed with `[Cline Agent]`).
    *   May include a reference to the `task_id` for traceability.
    *   The AI within the Cline Engine can be prompted to generate good commit messages.
*   **Author Information:** Commits made by agents should use a designated Git author name and email (e.g., "Cline Agent / cline-agent@example.com") to distinguish them from human commits.

### 4.4. Pushing Changes

*   After committing, the agent will push its working branch to the remote repository (origin).
*   Requires write permissions to the repository, managed via the access token used.

### 4.5. Creating Pull/Merge Requests (PR/MR)

*   **Primary Goal:** For many tasks, the final output will be a PR/MR for human review.
*   The agent (or the VCS Integration Service acting on its behalf) will use the Git provider's API (e.g., GitHub API, GitLab API) to create a PR/MR.
*   **PR/MR Details:**
    *   **Title:** Clear and descriptive, referencing the task.
    *   **Body:**
        *   Summary of changes made by the agent.
        *   Link back to the task in the Remote Cline Agent Platform dashboard.
        *   Any notes, warnings, or assumptions made by the agent.
        *   The AI can be prompted to generate this content.
    *   **Base Branch:** The original source branch.
    *   **Head Branch:** The agent's working branch.
    *   **Reviewers/Assignees:** Optionally configurable in the task definition or by platform defaults.
*   The URL of the created PR/MR will be a key result of the task, reported back to the Task Orchestrator and made available to the user.

### 4.6. Handling Merge Conflicts

*   **Initial Approach (MVP):** Agents will not attempt to resolve merge conflicts automatically. If a push fails due to conflicts or if the PR/MR cannot be automatically merged, the task may be marked as "completed_with_conflicts" or "requires_manual_intervention." The user will be responsible for resolving conflicts.
*   **Future Enhancements:** Explore strategies for agents to attempt conflict resolution for simple cases, or to notify users more proactively about potential conflicts.

## 5. Credential Management for VCS

*   **Secure Storage:** VCS access tokens (e.g., GitHub Personal Access Tokens - PATs) provided by users or generated via OAuth flows will be stored encrypted in the Secure Credentials Vault.
*   **Scoped Permissions:** Encourage users to provide tokens with the minimum necessary permissions (e.g., `repo` scope for GitHub).
*   **Short-Lived Credentials:**
    *   If possible, use mechanisms that provide short-lived credentials to agent instances (e.g., GitHub App's installation access tokens).
    *   The VCS Integration Service could be responsible for minting and securely passing these to agents.
*   **Revocation:** Users must be able to revoke or update their VCS credentials stored by the platform.

## 6. VCS Provider Support

*   **Initial Focus (MVP):** GitHub.
*   **Future Expansion:** GitLab, Bitbucket, and other popular Git hosting services. Abstraction layers will be needed in the VCS Integration Service or agent logic to support different provider APIs.

## 7. Error Handling in VCS Operations

*   Agents must robustly handle common Git errors (e.g., authentication failure, repository not found, branch not found, push conflicts).
*   Errors should be logged clearly and reported back to the Task Orchestrator.
