# P11: Data Management and Logging

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the strategies for managing various types of data within the Remote Cline Agent Platform, including user data, task data, agent logs, and application logs. Effective data management and comprehensive logging are crucial for platform operation, troubleshooting, analytics, and security.

## 2. Data Types and Storage Considerations

(Refer to P1: System Architecture and P3: Cloud Platform and Infrastructure for specific database/storage technology choices - TBD)

*   **User Data:**
    *   **Content:** User profiles (ID, name, email hash, preferences), authentication information (password hashes, MFA settings), API keys (hashed or references to vault), linked VCS accounts.
    *   **Storage:** Relational Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
    *   **Considerations:** Security (encryption at rest, access controls), PII compliance (GDPR, CCPA), data integrity.
*   **Task Data:**
    *   **Content:** Task definitions (ID, name, description, repo URL, instructions, agent config), status, timestamps (created, started, completed), user ID, links to results/artifacts, PR URLs, error messages.
    *   **Storage:** Relational or NoSQL Database (choice depends on query patterns, scalability).
    *   **Considerations:** Indexing for efficient querying by status/user, auditability, retention policies.
*   **Agent State Data:**
    *   **Content:** Live status of agent instances (idle, busy, assigned_task_id), health check information, resource allocation.
    *   **Storage:** Key-Value or In-Memory Database (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB) for low-latency access.
    *   **Considerations:** Ephemeral nature for some data, consistency with Agent Manager.
*   **Secure Credentials:**
    *   **Content:** AI API keys, VCS access tokens, internal service passwords.
    *   **Storage:** Dedicated Secure Credentials Vault (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
    *   **Considerations:** Strict encryption, access control, audit trails for access, rotation policies.
*   **Task Artifacts:**
    *   **Content:** Generated code diffs, log files from agent execution, reports, screenshots, any files produced by agents.
    *   **Storage:** Object Storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage).
    *   **Considerations:** Scalability, cost-effectiveness, durability, access control (e.g., pre-signed URLs for downloads), retention policies.
*   **Application Logs (Platform Services):**
    *   **Content:** Logs from API Gateway, Task Orchestrator, Agent Manager, Web Application, and other backend services (request/response logs, errors, debug information, performance metrics).
    *   **Storage:** Centralized Logging Service (e.g., ELK Stack, CloudWatch Logs, Azure Monitor Logs).
    *   **Considerations:** Structured logging (e.g., JSON), log levels, searchability, alerting, retention.
*   **Agent Execution Logs:**
    *   **Content:** Detailed logs from the Headless Cline Engine during task execution (AI interactions, tool usage, file operations, command outputs, errors).
    *   **Storage:** Initially streamed to Task Orchestrator, then persisted to Centralized Logging Service and/or Artifact Storage (for per-task log files).
    *   **Considerations:** Verbosity control, correlation with task ID, security (may contain snippets of code or sensitive info - needs review).

## 3. Data Retention Policies

*   Define retention policies for different data types based on business needs, regulatory requirements, and storage costs.
*   **Examples:**
    *   User Data: Retain as long as the account is active, anonymize/delete upon account closure request (subject to legal holds).
    *   Task Data: Retain for a defined period (e.g., 1 year), then archive or summarize.
    *   Task Artifacts & Agent Logs: Retain for a shorter period (e.g., 30-90 days), then archive or delete.
    *   Application Logs: Retain for a period suitable for troubleshooting and security analysis (e.g., 90 days in hot storage, longer in cold storage).
*   Implement automated processes for data archiving and deletion.

## 4. Logging Strategy

*   **Structured Logging:** Use a structured format (e.g., JSON) for all application and agent logs to facilitate easier parsing, searching, and analysis.
*   **Correlation IDs:** Include correlation IDs (e.g., `request_id`, `task_id`, `user_id`) in logs across different services to trace requests and task execution flows.
*   **Log Levels:** Implement standard log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL) and allow configurable log verbosity for different environments or components.
*   **Sensitive Information:** Avoid logging sensitive information (passwords, raw API keys, full PII) in plaintext. Mask or redact such data. Be cautious with agent logs that might capture code snippets.
*   **Centralization:** All logs should be shipped to a centralized logging platform.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting from Logs:** Configure alerts based on log patterns (e.g., high error rates, security events, specific error codes).

## 5. Data Backup and Recovery

*   (Covered in detail in P9: Scalability and Reliability)
*   Regular automated backups for all persistent data stores.
*   Test backup restoration procedures regularly.
*   Define RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective).

## 6. Data Access and Security

*   (Covered in detail in P8: Security Considerations)
*   Implement strict access controls (RBAC) for all data stores.
*   Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
*   Audit access to sensitive data.

## 7. Analytics and Reporting (Future Consideration)

*   As the platform matures, leverage collected data for analytics:
    *   User activity and engagement.
    *   Task success/failure rates, common error types.
    *   Agent performance metrics.
    *   Resource utilization patterns.
*   This data can inform product improvements, operational efficiency, and business decisions.
*   Consider data warehousing or data lake solutions for advanced analytics if needed.
